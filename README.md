Intensive Programming Workshop PE4

Team: Sean Fitze and Abeal Sileshi <br>
Person 1: Abeal Sileshi<br>
Person 2: Sean Fitze<br>

Our program runs through a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by asking the user for a row and column each turn. For example if you choose row 0 and col 1, you'll go here:
<p>
010<br>
000<br>
000<br> 
<p>
The program runs for nine turns. Have fun playing it!
