Intensive Programming Workshop PE4

Team: Sean Fitze and Abeal Sileshi
Person 1: Abeal Sileshi
Person 2: Sean Fitze

Our program runs through a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by asking the user for a row and column each turn. For example if you choose row 0 and col 1, you'll go here:
010
000
000

The program runs for nine turns. Have fun playing it!
